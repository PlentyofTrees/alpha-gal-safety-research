# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in this repository.

This project began as a personal research journey and has grown into a structured effort to document, synthesize, and explore evidence related to alpha-gal syndrome and food allergy risk. Contributions are welcome from individuals affected by alpha-gal syndrome, those supporting loved ones, and researchers or practitioners seeking to better understand a condition that is often misunderstood.

This is a research and documentation project focused on evidence synthesis, exploratory analysis, and identification of gaps in current knowledge.
