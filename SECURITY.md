# Security Policy

## Scope

This repository is a research and documentation project focused on evidence synthesis, terminology mapping, and exploratory analysis related to alpha-gal syndrome and food allergy risk.

At present, it primarily contains research notes, citations, and documentation. Over time, it may also include research code (for example, scripts or notebooks used for quantitative analysis). Any code included is intended for research transparency and reproducibility, not for deployment as a production system.

This repository does not provide versioned software releases or security-supported distributions.

## Evidence Status and Review

This repository may include a mix of:
- Peer-reviewed literature summaries
- Publicly available reports, policies, and guidance
- Exploratory analysis and research notes that have not undergone peer review

Non–peer-reviewed materials may be included to support transparency, hypothesis generation, and identification of gaps. Their presence does not imply validation, endorsement, or established consensus.

Where practical, materials or pages should indicate their review status (for example, "peer-reviewed summary" or "exploratory, not peer-reviewed").

## Reporting a Concern

If you believe content in this repository presents a security, privacy, safety, or misuse concern, you may:

- Open a GitHub issue describing the concern, or
- Use GitHub’s private vulnerability reporting feature if discretion is appropriate

Please include:
- A clear description of the concern
- The location of the content in question (file path and section, if possible)
- Any relevant public references or context

---

## What Not to Submit

Please do not submit:
- Identifiable patient or participant data
- Raw clinical records, claims files, or medical documentation containing personal identifiers
- Proprietary, restricted, or non-redistributable datasets
- Credentials, tokens, API keys, or other secrets
- Instructions intended to enable wrongdoing, exploitation, or unsafe use

---

## What This Repository Does Not Accept

This repository does not accept:
- Requests for security patches for production deployments
- Penetration testing results aimed at exploit development
- Requests for legal advice, medical advice, or claims guidance

---

## Response Expectations

Reports will be reviewed in good faith. Because this is a research repository, responses may involve clarification, revision, removal, or contextualization of content rather than technical remediation.

If research code is added, issues related to accidental exposure of secrets (for example, API keys) or unsafe handling of sensitive information will be prioritized for cleanup.
